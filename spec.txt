Randomized YouTube Thumbnail Generator

Hello!

I am looking to design a simple web app that generates YouTube thumbnails with a randomized "watermark" type PNG placed over the users image they upload.

The basic flow of the website:
1. User uploads their Youtube Thumbnail (must be certain ratio)
2. The website takes thumbnail and adds a randomized (roughly 25+ options) transparent PNG and puts it over the image thumbnail
3. The website presents the new thumbnail with the randomized image placed over it with a download image button.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
